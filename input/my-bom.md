## Software for LFR
For code on the Raspberry Pi Pico W, we'll be using [CircuitPython][19]
(a super set of [MicroPython][20], specifically designed to support Adafruit products).
For experienced coders, particularly Python coders,
they can work in a terminal window using the [Python REPL][21].

For less experienced coders,
there are some [block-based coding][22] tools available for MicroPython and CircuitPython.
These allowing users to program microcontrollers with a drag-and-drop interface.
The most notable options are [Piper Make][23] and [BIPES (Block based Integrated Platform for Embedded Systems)][24].

And for those people who's skills lay between beginner and experienced,
using the [Mu Editor][26] might be the answer.
