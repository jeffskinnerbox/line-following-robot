# Definitions
Below are some definitions of terms that will be shared by all the skills in `.claude/skills/`

## Contextual Definitions
Definitions for organizations, people, documents, and other things `.claude/skills/` need
to be aware to fulfill the `.claude/skills/` objective.

* **[Makersmiths][01]** is a [makerspace][02].
  Specifically a collaborative, physical workspace,
  located at private community center, designed for hands-on creation, learning, and innovation.
  It provide access to a diverse set of tools ranging from 3D printers, CNC machines,
  woodworking tools, electronic test equipment, laser cutters, metal smithing, and more.
  It also has low-tech arts & crafts supplies, allowing people to design, prototype, and build projects.
* **Project** refers to the thing be built or designed by students in a Makersmiths course.
* **Specifications** is the act of describing or identifying precisely requirements for a course, project, build, etc.
  This document is the class instructors vision / expectations for the course they plan to teach.
  This document could (but not necessarily) include tasks to be done, supplies to be purchased, things to be designed,
  how things should be assemble, how to test, how to operate, optional things to do, etc.

## Course Structure Definitions
Definitions related to how Makersmiths structures & executes its training curriculum.

* **Curriculum** refers to the one or more courses that a student would take to master a Makersmiths tool/machine,
  something be built, or a subject matter.
* **Course** is a structured, purposeful series of Classes (aka lessons or workshops) focusing on a
  specific subject, discipline, or skill set, typically spanning several weeks or months.
* **Class** is a 2 hour period when the students will gather together at Makersmiths.
  It is during this time period that nearly all of the project assemble, programming, and testing will take place.
  Some tasks will span multiple class periods to complete.
* **Design Session** contains one or more Class and are intended to
  define, design, implement, and test a major functional capability, that is,
  specific, measurable functions, features, and behaviors that the system provides.
  Design sessions will often build upon each other and evolving the project to new functionality.

## Course Documentation Definitions
Definition for key documents that will be created by the `.claude/skills/` to enable the Makersmiths teaching process.
Creation of these documents is the single most important thing to do by the `.claude/skills/`.

* **Syllabus** is a document that provides a foundational framework for a Makersmiths course.
  It including learning topics & objectives, policies, schedules, reference materials, prerequisites.
  It serves as a blueprint, often mandates by the instructor, to ensure consistency in learning experience for all students.
* **Lesson Plan** is the instructors’s detailed, step-by-step guide for a Design Session and the Classes it contains.
  It outlining learning objectives, educational materials, instructional methods, assembly instructions,
  relevant facts & observations, question to ask students, and student exercise to be performed.
  It functions as a roadmap to ensure effective instruction, classroom organization, and student engagement.
* **Bill of Materials (BOM)** is a comprehensive, structured list detailing all raw materials, components,
  sub-assemblies, and quantities required to to complete the course project.
  It acts as a central blueprint for project assembly, parts inventory management, and cost estimation,
  ensuring all parts are available to prevent delays.
  BOM typically include part name (with link to manufacture), descriptions, quantities, purchasing source (with a link to supplier), and unit cost.

  A BOM should have a corresponding Lesson Plan.
  A Lesson Plan should have a corresponding Syllabus.
  Syllabus, Lesson Plan, and BOM should all have a corresponding Specifications document.

## Documentation Sections Definitions
Definitions of sectional documentation that may appear in the Lesson Plan.
The `.claude/skills/` are expected to generate is documentation for an appropriate section.

* **History & Applications** gives an understanding *why* a technology exists and *how* it has been applied.
  Where did it come from? — Who invented it, when, why, and how did it evolve?
  Where has it been used? — What real-world problems has it solved, in what industries, and how has its use expanded or changed?
* **Theory of Operation** is a technical description explaining how
  a system, device, or component is designed to function, detailing the interaction of its parts,
  underlying scientific principles, and intended workflows.
  It provides a mental model used in documentation to facilitate troubleshooting, diagnostics, and user understanding.

  Not all Lesson Plans need to have these things.
  The will typically be created when the topic is complex, hard to understand, or not widely known.
