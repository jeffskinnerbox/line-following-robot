# My Claude Code Prompts

## 1st Claude Code Prompt
Read @my-vision.md and create a specification document, reflecting the incrementally development in the Line Following Robot (LFR) course.
I need this this specification document to help prepare me for delivery of the course in about 6 months.
I want all the components implied bellow (both hardware and software) to be built and tested in advance of the course.

I want the software to be built in a modular form, such that, a software subsystem in step N
can be pulled out a replaced with a new subsystem in step N+1 (e.g. PID Controller replaced with Q-Learning Controller)
Make sure you include the Line Track Designer and LFR Simulators software in this specification document.
Think harder about the software architecture and testing of the of this project.

Within the specification document you create (to be called "specification.md"), include this prompt,
all question you ask me, along with my responses.
Place this in an appendix and reference it at the beginning of the development plan
and anywhere else in the text when its a useful reference.

Use the AskUserQuestions tool for all things that require further clarification.
